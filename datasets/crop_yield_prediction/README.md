# Crop Yield Prediction Dataset

This directory contains datasets for crop yield prediction models.

## Directory Structure
- `historical_yield/` - Historical crop yield data
- `weather_data/` - Weather conditions affecting crop growth
- `soil_composition/` - Soil nutrient and composition data
- `farming_practices/` - Data on farming techniques and inputs used
- `satellite_imagery/` - Satellite images for crop monitoring and yield prediction

## Sample Files
Each directory contains sample CSV files showing the expected data format. Replace these with your actual datasets.

## Data Columns
- Historical yield: year, crop_type, location, yield_tonnes_per_hectare
- Weather data: date, location, temperature_celsius, rainfall_mm, humidity_percent, sunlight_hours
- Soil composition: location, ph_level, nitrogen_ppm, phosphorus_ppm, potassium_ppm, organic_matter_percent
- Farming practices: season, crop_type, fertilizer_type, fertilizer_amount_kg_per_hectare, irrigation_method, pesticide_used
