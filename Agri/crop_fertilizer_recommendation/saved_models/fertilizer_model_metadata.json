  "sample_explanation": "Based on the analysis of your soil conditions and crop type, DAP is the recommended fertilizer for your farm.\n\nKey factors supporting this recommendation:\n- Soil nutrients (N:40.0, P:35.0, K:60.0) indicate nitrogen deficiency, making nitrogen-rich fertilizers like Urea ideal.\n- Soil pH (6.5) is optimal for most crops and fertilizer uptake.\n\nDAP is recommended because:\n- High phosphorus content (46% P2O5)\n- Promotes root development and flowering\n- Best applied at planting time\n\nFor Wheat cultivation:\n- Apply according to recommended rates based on soil test results\n- Consider split applications for better nutrient uptake\n- Monitor plant response and adjust application rates accordingly",
